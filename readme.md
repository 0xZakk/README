# README

Written by: Zachary (Zakk) Fleischmann, Team Lead, Web Development Immersive at
General Assembly.

## Why this README?

I wrote this document to share my expectations with my team members. It is
intended as a guide to what I expect from others and what they should expect
from me. My hope is that this helps you better understand where I'm coming from
and how I work, and that it makes it easier and more enjoyable for us to work
together.

This is public so that it is easier for you to hold me accountable.

## Disclaimer

This README applies to me only and in no way should be considered to apply to
General Assembly (my current employer) or any past employer.

## My Role

My role as Team Lead involves wearing a couple of hats, namely: manager, mentor,
instructor, and subject matter expert. The way I see it, my core
responsibilities to my fellow instructors and coworkers are to:

* Provide clarity, context, and direction for Web Development Immersive, as
    a product
* Set expectations for my team and measure against those
* Mentor
* Improve (or guide improvement to) our processes
* Contribute to General Assembly's strategy
* Recruit other awesome instructors

My responsibilities to our students are to:

* Ensure an emotionally safe space to learn
* Provide world class instruction and an amazing learning environment
* Shepard students through the transition to becoming developers
* Keep our learning materials current and fresh
* Make sure you're having fun, but are challenged

Assume that I make mistakes and want to improve. You will be doing me a huge
favor if you hold me accountable to these or if you tell me something I am doing
negatively affects you. I'm here to serve you, not the other way around.

## My Values

**Communication**

**Inclusion**

**Initiative**

**Creating Value**

**Ownership**

**Getting Things Done**

**Questioning Authority** Something you'll probably hear me repeat from time to time is, "nothing is sacred." What I mean by this is nothing is *not* subject to change. Just because someone said we have to do something a certain way, doesn't mean we absolutely have to do it that way. Just because we've been doing something a certain way for a long time, does not mean we have to continue to do it that way. When you make a proposal, I will question it - whether you're my boss or my subordinate. When I make a proposal, you can and absolutely should question it.

## What I Expect of You

* If I'm your manager, that **does not** mean you have to agree to or adhere to
    all my values

### What Will Disappoint Me

**Sloppy/unprofessional work.** It's totally fine if an idea is still half-baked
or you're still drafting a solution to a problem! Shipping something that is
half-baked is not fine.

**Homeostasis.** (i.e. maintaining the status quo) Change is constant. It's
imperative that we improve what we do and how we do it. I want to have an
honest and thoughtful discussion about change, but I don't want resistance to
change just because it's new or different.

## What You Can Expect of Me

## My Features

Here is a collection of things that I think make me a good manager and coworker:

**Vim is my primary text editor:** No further explanation necessary üòé

## My Bugs

We all have 'em! Here are (some of) mine:

**I love bad jokes:** You'll find yourself rolling your eyes more often than
not. If someone tells a bad joke, mine will be the inverse of all other
reactions: I'll die laughing hysterically while everyone else rolls their eyes
and groans. My favorite jokes is: how do you sooth a bug in JavaScript? You
`console` it! ü§£ It kills me every time!

## Quirks and Other Stuff

Not quite bugs, not quite features. Here are a few miscellaneous things to know
about me:

**I ‚ù§Ô∏è spreadsheets:** I genuinely believe that, armed with the right
spreadsheets, I could conquer the world. I use them, I abuse them. I love
them, I'll try to make you love them too.

**I'm a Monica:** There absolutely are correct and incorrect ways to load the
dishwasher, how do you focus on anything if everything is disorganized, and we
absolutely have to win!

**I *love* asking questions:** What if we do something this way?

**I like working:**

I will often work late and on the weekends. **I do not expect you to do the
same, except under exceptional circumstances.** I will actively try to avoid
seeming like I'm working a lot, like waiting to push commits until Monday
morning or scheduling emails to go out at a reasonable hour, but I'm just
covering my tracks. You'll find out sooner or later, so I may as well be honest
upfront.

I do want to be clear about one thing though: I work late because I want to.
When someone *has* to work late, it's because of a failure of management:
someone didn't staff or scope a project properly, someone was given too much
work, or someone didn't manage their time well. I firmly believe this to be
true. So if you find yourself working late, we need to get to the bottom of why.
Who failed and needs to learn from it? It could be me.

## Other Expectations

### How to Get My Attention

Is someone hurt or in danger? Call 911.

Slack me - I'll respond when I see it or when I can. If it's urgent, come tap me
on the shoulder. I'll evaluate where it bubbles to in my priority queue (see what I did there?).

### Work Hours

Work hours are from 9:00ish am to 5:00ish pm. Is your work getting done? Carry
on. Are you contributing as much as your peers? Carry on.

### Availability

I'm definitely available between 9:00 and 5:00. Always feel free to reach out to
me on Slack or by email and I'll respond as soon as I can.

### One-on-Ones

This is time for us to get to know each other and to make sure you have goals
and are working towards them! I also want to make sure you are (a) happy, (b)
not over worked, and (c) challenged/engaged.

## Final Thoughts

I'd like to conclude this document with two thoughts:

1. This README is hosted on GitHub, where it is open source
1. That is intentional

Please understand this is very much a work in progress: I will make and commit
changes throughout my career as my values evolve and as I grow as a manager.

Also understand that you are free to fork this README to either make a pull
request or make it your own. Want to create your own README? Please do! It's
a rewarding experience. Fork this one and use the outline. Think I should update
something in here based on your experience with working with me? Make a pull
request! ‚ù§Ô∏è Think something in here is inaccurate or unclear? Make an issue and
I'd love to discuss it with you!
